<h1>Lessons from <i>Software</i></h1>
<p>The <i>Software</i> exhibition was curated by Jack Burnham for the Jewish Museum in 1970. 
The exhibition was first-of-its-kind in many regards, but its reception has been clouded over by a discourse on its ''failures.''
Unsurprisingly, the reception of failure has clouded over aspects of the exhibition that provide models for curating exhibitions
of work in all media.

This list is a partial remedy to the exhibition's current reception. Some lessons were implemented imperfectly
for the <i>Software</i> exhibition, but they can be adapted more easily in the 2020s.
 
<p>Lessons to follow from <i>Software</i>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hire a technical advisor to remain on-site prior, during, and after the opening of the exhibition.</li>
  <li>If popular works are crowded, give visitors something to do while waiting in line.</li>
  <li>Keep the museum open until 11:00 p.m.</li>
<li>Reuse materials and equipment. Give artists first dibs on purchasing equipment used in the exhibition.</li>
<li>Give artists first dibs on purchasing discounted equipment after it was used in the exhibition.</li>
<li>For artists with custom-made equipment, consider including a ''Portable repair kit'' with your work, in case any problems arise
during the run of the exhibition.</li>
<li>Give your artists ample installation time: over a month, if necessary.</li>
<li>Show both the software and hardware.</li>
<li>Make sure to hire extra staff -- not unpaid volunteers -- to supervise each interactive work. </li>

</ol>

<p>Lessons to learn from <i>Software</i>.</p>
<li>Prepare for climate change. </li> 
<li> If works are to be shown on individual monitors, keep in mind
that this number will need to be in proportion to the number of expected visitors. </li>
<li> If you hire a sponsor, donâ€™t let them restrict the type of computers you can use. </li>
<li> A month of install time won't matter if the equipment is not working. </li>
<li> Don't hire a technical advisor who is also busy with installing and programming their own work in the
exhibition. </li>
<li> Give credit to the women. </li>
<li> Choose an appropriate sponsor, not one facing several lawsuits from state and federal governments. </li>
<li> Don't let corporations take their equipment out of your exhibition because they need to use it elsewhere. </li>
